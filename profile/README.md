## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is an on-going effort for using *quasimetrics* to improve deep learning applications! *Quasimetrics* are *asymmetrical* distances that show up in our every day lives (e.g., walking on a hill), and are integral in <ins>decision making</ins> and <ins>task solving</ins>. 

## Our Projects

+ [`quasimetric-learning/torch-quasimetric`](https://github.com/quasimetric-learning/torch-quasimetric): State-of-The-Art Quasimetric Models in PyTorch. Deep neural networks that are guaranteed to be quasimetrics.
